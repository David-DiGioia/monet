# vulkan-renderer

A Vulkan render engine. Much of the code in this repository is inspired by [Vulkan Guide](https://vkguide.dev/), an excellent tutorial. Many thanks to the authors!

If you're learning Vulkan, you may find my [Vulkan Diagrams repository](https://github.com/David-DiGioia/vulkan-diagrams) informative.
